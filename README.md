1. [Maximum consecutive 1's in an array of zeros and ones .](https://play.golang.org/p/KtNr9XS6aOT) 

-- Given an array of 1's and 0's , We need to find the maximum consecutive's 1 that can be in that array. 

My approach :  
  a) range over that array and check the value , if value is zero , then assign a counter variable to zero 
  otherwise , increment the counter variable
  b) then pass that incremented counter variable into a function that will find the no of max consecutive 1
